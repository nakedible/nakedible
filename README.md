With nearly three decades of professional programming under my belt, I've seen
the digital landscape evolve from the early days of the internet to the
cloud-native world we live in today. And let me tell you, it's just memes all
the way down.

I have a personal [website](https://nakedible.org) and I write
[articles](https://nakedible.org/blog) sometimes. You might find stuff of
interest there.
