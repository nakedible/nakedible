With nearly three decades of professional programming under my belt, I've seen
the digital landscape evolve from the early days of the internet to the
cloud-native world we live in today. And let me tell you, it's just memes all
the way down.

## What I Do

I specialize in crafting robust, secure systems that often stand at the
intersection of payments, cloud computing, and cutting-edge security practices.
My expertise spans:

- **Payment Systems**: From card payments to eCommerce, I've navigated the
  complex world of financial transactions already for 15 years. Nobody who's
  seen behind the veil will sleep well again.
- **Cloud Architecture**: If it's not in version control, it doesn't exist, and
  doubly so if it's infrastructure. All cloud applications needs to be built
  natively from the outside in, rather than starting from the code to figure out
  how it should be hosted.
- **Security & Cryptography**: I believe in security by design, and making it
  right rather than to rely on defense in depth. PCI DSS is a swamp, so it's an
  all too familiar fight to balance real world security with compliance rules.
- **Entrepreneurship**: I've founded and successfully sold companies, and it's
  always in my heart, but currently simply at a salaried position.

## Tech I Love

- **Languages**: Rust is my current passion. But I'm polyamorous, so that's not
  my only love.
- **Cloud**: AWS is the old and comfortable fling, but CloudFlare is the new
  hotness. They have a ton of really cool stuff that doesn't get nearly enough
  attention.
- **Cryptography**: Fascinated by elegant cryptographic protocols with real
  world usage rather than the underlying algorithms. J-PAKE and Keccak have a special place in my heart.
- **Challenges**: You'll find me waking up at 7 AM on Christmas Eve to solve
  Advent of Code. Also, screw timezones.

## Beyond the Code

I love swinging a sword, in more ways than one. Take that as you will.
