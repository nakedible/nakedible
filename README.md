With nearly three decades of professional programming under my belt, I've seen
the digital landscape evolve from the early days of the internet to the
cloud-native world we live in today. And let me tell you, it's just memes all
the way down.

I have a personal website [nakedible.org](https://nakedible.org) and a blog
[nakedible.org/blog](https://nakedible.org/blog). You might find stuff of
interest there.
