...and you can quote me on that.

In the corporate world, the belief that multi cloud is the way to go is almost ubiquitous. The idea is that by using multiple cloud providers, you can avoid vendor lock-in, improve availability and get the best of all worlds. But in reality, multi cloud is a mistake that has more downsides than upsides.

I aim to explain why by going through the relevant topics one by one.
